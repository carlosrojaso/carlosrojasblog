As I write this article, I’ve been looking at an interesting technology called [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

If you are following me in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/carlosrojas84) or in [Github](https://github.com/carlosrojaso) you know I develop in Ionic Framework and, apart from having good Starters in the Market. Still, it is good to understand new technologies that are gaining strength among the communities.

First of all, it is important to understand the range of technologies nowadays. In this graphic I’ve placed three classifications and some technologies that seem to be mentioned frequently in each platform.

<h2>Hybrid Apps</h2> 

These are constructed in top of Apache Cordova and basically they allow you to develop an app using HTML + CSS + JS surrounded by a Webview (specifying the Android or IOS SDK) which gives you access to the native characteristics of the device and allow you to extend the functionality through plugins (small pieces of Java or Swift code — Objective C). This classification is much more complete in [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).

<h2>Cross Platform App</h2> 

The Apps created through these technologies are native (They don’t only include a Webview). Its principal characteristic is that they are written in Javascript and they use a compiler to convert them into Native components. It is considered that [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) are the most important parts of this technology.

<h2>Native Apps</h2> 

These are constructed using programming language supported by the official SDK of the device. It is necessary to develop an independent project for each platform and its SDK’s are very complete. The languages to be used are Objective-C or Swift for IOS and Java for Android.

Well, basically this is the summary about the world of mobile development. To select among these is not easy but you can use these criteria as well as available time for the development and budget.

Keep coding...
