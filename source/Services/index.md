I'm a **Product Coach** and **Ionic Developer** I’ve been teaching developers these technologies for years and now offer *consulting services* to help **you** or **your development team**.

I currently only offer support via email. Since I still have other commitments (Like Blogging here), it’s much more efficient for me to sit down and work through all my consulting emails at once. Organising calls, chats and screen shares unfortunately takes up too much time. Sorry for that.

<blockquote>Time is my only resource as a Consultant.</blockquote>
